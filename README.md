Learning-1 : Was having issue during git push due to two github accounts . I got to know that , for each repository we can set git user and git email id 
Steps 
- go to that directory in local
- git config user.name "NasrathN"
- git config user.email "nasrath.n@outlook.com"

I could do git push after this.

If i come out of that directory , and check the value of user and email - I get the actual values stored in config file .
To check username and email id :
git config user.name
git config user.email
